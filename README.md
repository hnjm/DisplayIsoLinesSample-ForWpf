# Display IsoLines for Wpf

### Description
In this sample we show how you can use Map Suite to add isolines (commonly known as contour lines) to your .NET application. Isolines are a way to visualize breaks between different groups of data such as elevation levels, soil properties, or just about anything else you can imagine. This sample also shows the various steps in creating isolines, including the gathering of point data, creating a grid using interpolation, and finally, picking your isoline break levels. We also quickly dive into some more advanced options such as generating isolines on the fly. 

To bring this all together, check out our [instructional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eejtCTftpzo) that will walk you through the process of setting up and working with isolines in Map Suite. 

Please note that you will need version 5.0.87.0 or newer of Map Suite in order to use isolines. For more information on how to upgrade, see the [Map Suite Daily Builds Guide](http://wiki.thinkgeo.com/wiki/map_suite_daily_builds_guide). 

From 6.0.187.0, the sample has been updated that polygons can also be returned as IsoLines results. You need version 6.0.187.0 or newer of Map Suite in order to use this sample.
